### ðŸ”° **Overview**

Screen awaker: The name itself is self-explanatory, this project will use to awaken the screen as long as we want as per the requirement.

### ðŸ”° **Goal**

My goal is to create a customizable screen awakening project which works as per the user timestamp and duration for repeating the process. 
> EX: Suppose I am watching a tutorial of 31 minutes and my deafult screen timer will let the system sleep after 10 minutes, so using this I can put the screen awaker active to move after 9 minutes repeated until I stop. 

### ðŸ”° **Motivation**

The major challenge I use to face while watching some long tutorials is sleeping down of the system after a certain period of time, though we have any alternative to increase the time duration from system settings without altering the primary system setting I have designed which is totally customizable as per user need.

### ðŸ”° **Build Status**

Right now the system is Bug-free.

### ðŸ”° **Tech/Framework used**

1) Programming language: Python
2) Libraries used: pyautogui, time

> NOTE: 'PyAutoGUI' *uses the screen coordinates to determine the exact position to perform actions such as clicking, typing, scrolling, pressing, and dragging.*

### ðŸ”° **Contribute**

Right now the system is acceptable from a tech standpoint but this is a genuine problem faced by mainly nontech people.

Would like to develop this with a proper interface where without directly altering the code side, the user can utilize the capabilities of the project.

Open contributions are needed.
