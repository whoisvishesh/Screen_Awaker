⚪**Project Title**

Screen awaker: The name itself is self explanatory, this project will use to awake the screen as long as we want as per the requirement.

⚪**Motivation**

The major challenge I use to face while watching some long tutorials is sleeping down of system after certain peroid of time, though we have any alternative to increase the time duration from system settings but without alterting the main system setting I have designed which is totally customizable as per user need.

⚪**Build Status**

Right now the system is Bug free.

⚪**Tech/Framework used**

1) Programming language: Python
2) Libraries used: pyautogui, time

NOTE: *PyAutoGUI uses the screen coordinates to determine the exact position to perform actions such as clicking, typing, scrolling, pressing, and dragging.* 

⚪**Contribute**

Right now the system is acceptable from tech stand point but this is the genuine problem faced by mainy non tech people.

Would like to develop this with a proper interface where without directly alterning the code side, the user can utiise the capabilities of the project.

Open contributions are needed.

⚪**Credits**

This is a guided project
