ðŸ”°Project Title

Screen awaker: The name itself is self-explanatory, this project will use to awaken the screen as long as we want as per the requirement.

ðŸ”°Motivation

The major challenge I use to face while watching some long tutorials is sleeping down of the system after a certain period of time, though we have any alternative to increase the time duration from system settings without altering the primary system setting I have designed which is totally customizable as per user need.

ðŸ”°Build Status

Right now the system is Bug-free.

ðŸ”°Tech/Framework used

Programming language: Python
Libraries used: pyautogui, time
NOTE: PyAutoGUI uses the screen coordinates to determine the exact position to perform actions such as clicking, typing, scrolling, pressing, and dragging.

ðŸ”°Contribute

Right now the system is acceptable from a tech standpoint but this is a genuine problem faced by mainly nontech people.

Would like to develop this with a proper interface where without directly altering the code side, the user can utilize the capabilities of the project.

Open contributions are needed.

ðŸ”°Credits

This is a guided project
